### Hi, I am Lee Je-Hee :)
I'm a previous bioinformatics researcher from Seoul, South Korea, and now staying in Toronto, Canada.    

I'm interested in **how to adapt Machine Learning algorithm to Bioinformatics tools** to improve the performance.    
In addition, I have a passion to learn **scRNA-seq, proteomics, and Multi-omics**.    

You can [**check my MIND MAP**](https://jhlee0637.github.io/) where I organize what I learn everyday!
