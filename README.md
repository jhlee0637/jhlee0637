### Hi, I am Lee Je-Hee :)
I'm a previous bioinformatics researcher from Seoul, South Korea, and now staying in Toronto, Canada.    

I'm interested in **how to adapt Machine Learning algorithm to Bioinformatics tools** to improve the performance.    
In addition, I have a passion to learn **scRNA-seq based Multi-omics including transcriptomics, epigenomics, and so on**.    

[I am keep documentizing my studying through published Obsidian page also.](https://publish.obsidian.md/jhlee/today-i-learned/README) I hope you like them!
